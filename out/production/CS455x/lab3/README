Lab 3

Note: On-campus students can put their answers to the lab questions in this file, or in a text file created in another text editor, or use a piece of paper they can show to their lab TA.  DEN students will need to put their answers in this README, so they will get submitted.


Question 1.1.. The first set of tests has a sequence of two purchases recorded, a payment given, and then change given for that payment. Show a formula that describes how the expected result for the change given was arrived at for this first sequence.
Show all purchase amounts and the payment amount in this formula. You will need to look at the code in CashRegTester.java to do this.

0.25 = (2 + 0*0.25 + 5*0.1 + 0*0.05 + 0*0.01) - 0.75 - 1.50

Question 1.2.. You should have gotten a round-off error in your results. Why do you get such an error? (You don't have to do any computations, just explain the issue.) Hint: this is discussed in section 4.1.1 of the textbook.

The double data type uses binary number system to represent floats. The binary number system cannot represent 4.35 exactly and rounded the value to the nearest match.
